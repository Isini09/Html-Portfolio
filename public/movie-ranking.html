<p>First of all this is an evergreen movie and my favourite movie, there is no lack of comedy, romance and emotional scenes. <br>
    This movie is mainly based on life of engineering students more commonlu university students and how they deal with their life when they first come to college.<br>
    We can also see a brief overview of hostel Life, how they spend their days at the hostel and how they deal with the constant exam pressure.<br>
    We can also learn many life lessons from this movie. Over all the movie is Absolutely Amazing.</p>
<h3>Nimona</h3>

<p>I can't sing enough praises for this absolute masterfully made film!!<br>
    The animation is GORGEOUS and so dynamic and incredible! The artstyle is so unique and each frame is full of immense detail and awe. <br>
    The story,-oh my goodness- is beautiful, compelling, heartbreaking and truly poignant, and left me on the verge of tears towards the end.<br>
    The overarching message and themes of prejudice, belonging, conformance, and morality were all translated perfectly in this film.</p>
<h3>The Govenant</h3>
